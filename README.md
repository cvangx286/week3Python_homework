        f"-------------------------\n"
        f"Largest County: {largest_county}\n"

## Election Audit Summary
In conclusion, utilizing this code has helped with providing a quick summary of the outcomes of this election. We are able to utilize this code to also provide data for how many voters were participating in the election. If we had data to compare total votes to the population, we could further evaluate what percentages of county residents did and did not participate in the poll. We also could analyze the demographics if the data was available using this code. 

The code could be easily modified to apply to other elections or polls by identifying and changing our dictionaries and variables.
